TaskTool - a To-Do / Task manager

By Roland Waddilove as a Python learning exercise

A popular exercise suggested by Python tutorials and courses is a task manager or to-do list. Here is mine.

It goes a bit further than most task managers and it saves settings to your home folder.

It saves tasks as TaskTool.csv. You can create tasks, set a due date, set daily, weekly, yearly, repeating options, 
sort by title, due, done, or label. And more.

You can choose where to save the data file. If you save it in a synced folder, you can use TaskTool across computers. 
Eg. I use Mega online drive and sync a folder across Mac and PC. TaskTool therefore appears on both computers.

It's not perfect, but it was a useful learning exercise for me.
